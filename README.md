## A few things that interest me

- Games: favorite is a toss-up between FFXIV: Shadowbringers and The Last of Us
- Horror: for some reason, I love watching horror movies
- TV: my favorite show is Elementary
- Dining: I **love** trying new restaurants and/or bars

And that's all I can think of for now.
